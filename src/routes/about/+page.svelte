  <h1>about me :)</h1>
  <p>Hello! I'm Lyssa and I'm an aspiring game designer from California.</p>

  <p>
    I am currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science: Game Design at
    University of California: Santa Cruz and am hoping to get a master's in the
    same field with a focus on experience design in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
    Games have always been a fascination for me, especially their communicative
    experiences. I very much enjoy watching people navigate through game
    environments and interacting with game characters. Their thoughts about what
    the game conveys and their connections with these in-game worlds are very
    important to me. I, too, would like to use games as a form of expression and
    communcation.
  </p>
