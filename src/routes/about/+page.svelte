  <h1>about me :)</h1>
  <p>Hello! I'm Lyssa and I'm an aspiring game designer from California.</p>

  <p>
    I am currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science: Game Design at
    University of California: Santa Cruz and am hoping to get a Masters in the
    same field with a focus on experience design in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
    Games have always been a fascination for me, especially their communicative
    experiences. I very much enjoy watching people navigate through games
    environments and interacting with game characters. Their thoughts about what
    the game convey and their connections with these in game worlds are very
    important to me. I too would like to use games as a form of expression and
    communcation.
  </p>
